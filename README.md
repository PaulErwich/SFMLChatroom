# chatroom++ template

The chatroom will not run on its own.

The project was created using Clion and requires different
environment variables to run.

The "doServer" env variable needs to be 1 of 3 values

0 creates a server

1 creates a client

2 creates a MegaServer

The project is also only setup for LocalHost but does work between PCs granted
that the IP addresses are changed for connection.
